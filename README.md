# Order in Disorder: Clustering to identify conformational ensembles in IDP using Node2Vec embedding & GMMs

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project "Order in Disorder: Clustering to identify conformational ensembles in IDP using Node2Vec embedding & GMMs" by Aryan Laroia, conducted in May 2024.

## Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are crucial biomolecules with diverse functions and connections to various diseases. Their intrinsic flexibility and dynamic behavior challenge traditional protein structure-function relationships. Advanced computational methods are necessary to understand their dynamic behavior and unravel their roles in biology. Our focus is on employing advanced, unconventional computational approaches to tackle this challenge. Specifically, we target the Aβ42 peptide, central to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, whose intrinsic disorder complicates traditional structure-function analyses. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning techniques, we aim to map the extensive conformational space of IDPs, identifying crucial ensembles for functional understanding and potential therapeutic interventions. A key breakthrough lies in reducing vast conformational datasets to manageable representative structures, enabling efficient analysis and enhancing our grasp of disorder-function relationships. These insights pave the way for innovative drug design strategies targeting IDPs, promising advancements in therapeutic interventions.
